 Building:
 If you want to build a working .exe file of this collection of files,
 here are some of the things you can do.


 Dev-C++ users:
	If you are a Dev-C++ user, all you have to do is paste all the
	files of the repo into a project file. 
 	- A project is file is made by pressing, "File" at the top 
  	left corner, and pressing "New".
	- It'll show 2 options, "Source File", and "New Project". Pick
 	"New Project", and then press the 2nd option you see, named
	"Console Application". 
 	- Put the contents of "main.cpp" that you pulled from the repo,
  	and paste it in the first file you have.
	- From there, continue on making new files accordingly, and save
 	them according to their file extensions and names.
